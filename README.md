# GAMES
There are 2 games developed by me using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
The one is TIC TAC TOE.
The another one is Stone Paper Scissors.
TIC TAC TOE is a js based game where two players can play the game like usual and when then the one will win the game,
an announcement section will be displayed announcing the winner(O OR X).
There is a refresh button too where you can clear the board in between the game and start playing again.

Stone Paper Scissors is the game where an individual can play the game with computer.
There are three interfaces ✊ for stone, ✋ for paper and ✌ for scissors.
One can choose any one of the three then computer will choose any one from them randomly using random() in javascript.
And then according to selection, the dasboard will show whether you win , loss or the game is draw.
And there is a scoreboard too where the score of the winner increases every time by 1.
And you can also compare who win more by seeing the scoreboard.
